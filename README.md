## Project Name
GoBasicProjects
## About
This repository contains a collection of small Go programs designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts in the Go language. Each file focuses on a specific feature of Go, such as variables, control structures, functions, slices, and basic mathematical operations, providing a practical introduction to Go programming.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Go installed on your system. For one of the programs, the math package from the Go standard library is required. No additional external libraries are needed.
## Features
This GoBasicProjects includes these features:

-Basic input/output operations using fmt.Println

-Variable declarations and string concatenation

-Arithmetic operations with numeric types

-Control structures including loops and conditionals

-Slice manipulation and basic function implementation

-String length calculation and mathematical computations using the math package

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/GoBasicProjects.git`
## Usage
Navigate to the project directory, then run any Go script (e.g., main.go) from the command line:
`go run main.go`

Each file in the repository is a standalone Go program demonstrating a specific concept, such as printing "Hello, World!", swapping variables, or calculating the area of a circle.
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master Go’s basic syntax, including variable declarations, loops, and conditionals

-Understand how to work with slices and perform string operations

-Apply Go’s standard library for mathematical computations and formatting

-Practice writing modular, single-purpose programs to reinforce core programming concepts
